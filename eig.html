            <p>Ethical investment is what happens when you match your values about real-world impact to your goals
                for a
                financial return. </p>

                <h1>Why Invest Ethically?</h1>
                <p class="lead">Most Kiwis are aware of ways that their purchases have an impact on climate change, the
                    environment, or people. </p>
            </div>

            <p>Not buying factory-farmed eggs or cosmetics tested on animals. Choosing fair trade, less carbon-intensive
                or lower waste products. Walking more and driving less. These are all small changes in our lives that
                collectively put pressure on companies to change their behaviour.</p>
            <p><strong>Investing is no different. How we choose to invest our money makes a real impact.</strong></p>
            <p>It’s up to you to decide whether that’s a negative or positive impact.</p>
            <figure>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Buying local produce, shopping without plastic, and purchasing ethically made clothing are
                        excellent decisions, but investing your money in ethical funds can have a much bigger impact on
                        people and the planet. Mindful Money enables exactly that.</p>

            <h2>You can earn good returns</h2>
            <p>It’s a myth that investing ethically means lower returns. In fact, <a
                    href="https://mindfulmoney.nz/pages/7/returns/">research</a> has shown that ethical investing earn
                returns that are as high or higher than conventional investing. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why are the returns on ethical investment proving so high?</h3>
            <p>This is because companies with high sustainability standards are the most <strong><em>trusted
                    </em></strong>companies. They have loyal customers and motivated employees. They have lower risks –
                they don’t get sued for environmental damage and they don’t operate in declining industries like coal or
                oil. As a result, their financial returns are high.</p>
            <p>By contrast, there has been a string of companies that have behaved badly and suffered financially as a
                result - VW, BP, Enron, Solid Energy (Pike River mine). </p>

            <p>As an example, the chart above shows the value of investments in fossil fuel companies over the past ten
                years. Since 2015, there have been ample warnings about the high risk of unusable oil, gas and coal
                reserves – our planet would fry if we used them all. These ‘stranded assets’ are likely to be worthless.
            </p>
            <p>This chart shows the trend. Over the past 5 years, the average price of shares (S&P500 index) has almost
                doubled while the Oil & Gas Index has halved (Orange), and coal has collapsed (Blue). More than half the
                coal mines in the US have <a

            <p>It’s easy to find out, all you will need to know is:</p>

                <li>Which KiwiSaver fund or investment fund provider you are with</li>
                <li>What type of fund you are in (conservative, growth, etc).</li>

                        by
                        calling 0800 KiwiSaver. </small></p>
            </div>
            <p>This checker gives you the full picture – not just the companies your fund invests indirectly, but
                also the indirect investments through the funds they invest in.</p>
            <p>Your investments are matched with the issues that most Kiwis are concerned about, as measured through
                our <a href="https://mindfulmoney.nz/news/entry/consumers-money-ethical-investing/">annual
                    surveys.</a></p>
            <p>You can then decide whether that’s OK or if you’d like to find a more ethical option.</p>

                    <p>I thought I was already invested in an ethical KiwiSaver. However, Mindful Money showed me
                        that there is a difference between what I call "responsible" investing and what the big
                        banks do. Plus it made taking action on this information really easy.</p>

            <p>Even though most Kiwis want their fund providers to avoid unethical investments, $4.1 billion of
                KiwiSaver funds are invested in the sectors that are of most concern. </p>
            <p>Choosing a fund that aligns with your values will ensure that your money isn’t being used to fund
                harmful impacts, but instead, is used to support good companies and positive impacts.</p>

                    to change this. </p>
                <p>Currently there are some New Zealand impact investment funds available to professional investors,
                    but not available yet to members of the public. We want to demonstrate that there is public
                    demand for impact investing and give the public opportunities to invest with positive social
                    and/or environmental impact.</p>
                <p>Change will be driven by consumer demand, so if enough people say that they want impact
                    investing, we can make it happen.</p>

            <h3>Investments are often put into different categories, depending on the level of risk:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Defensive </strong>– a high proportion of relatively safe investments (such as cash or
                    short term deposits)</li>
                <li><strong>Conservative </strong>– a high proportion of debt (generally bonds) and less shares</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced </strong>– a balance of debt and shares</li>
                <li><strong>Growth </strong>– mainly company shares, generally listed on seigk exchanges</li>
                <li><strong>Aggressive </strong>– some high growth, high-risk shares including small unlisted
                    companies or property</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are young and saving for the long term, you may choose to accept higher risks (on the basis
                that the highs and lows even out over time). Those who are approaching retirement generally prefer
                less risk, to ensure their savings are protected.</p>
            <p>There is a very handy guide to finding out your risk profile on the <a
